            <li>What is covid-19 ?</li>
            <p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
                discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
                before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>
             <li>How does Covid-19 spread ?</li>
             <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
                disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
                the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                coughs or exhales.</p>
             <li>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?</li> 
             <p>No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial
                infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.</p>
